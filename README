spotify installer README

USAGE

This is an attempt to create something which installs the spotify
debian package in a distro independent way. The goal is to support
three usecases:

  - User-only install without root privileges.
  - System-wide FHS-compliant installs in e. g., /usr/local, separating
    architecture-dependent data and arched according to FHS, keeping
    handling different data in .../lib vs .../li64.
  - Temporary installs used in a packaging context.

Although not based on automake in any way it's run in the same way
using configure, make and make install. Some examples:

Installing in system directories e. g., installing in
/opt/local/lib[64] and /opt/local/share with a binary in /usr/bin.
(yes, bad example, I know):

   $ ./configure  --prefix=/opt --bindir=/usr/bin
   $ make download
   # make install
   # make register

Installing in a temporary dir e. g. in a packaging context with all
sources already in place:

   $ ./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/lib64
   $ make DESTDIR=/tmp/spotify install

Making a user install without root privileges installs in
~/.local/share with a binary in ~/bin, downloading sources
as required:

   $ ./configure --user
   $ make download
   $ make install
   $ make register

Other variants are possible using e. g. the --bindir or --libdir
arguments to configure. Use configure -h to find out. The register
target notifies system about new icons etc. There is also a
'uninstall' target.

This has so far only been tested on Fedora, so don't expect to run out
of the box elsewhere. Time will tell if this is usable enough to get the
proper fixes for other distros. As of now, this is just an experiment.

DEPENDENCIES

This is an installer, not a package. It has no automatic dependencies.
That said, the configure script tries to check the buildtime dependencies
and report missing items.

The Makefile tracks the runtime dependencies from spotify using ldd. It
will report missing links, and try to symlink to existing system libraries
in some simple cases. This is reported as INFO: lines.

If there is unresolved runtime dependencies in spotify it's reported as
ERROR lines.

USER INSTALLS

User installs have some caveats:

- The binary is by default in ~/bin. Your PATH must include this; this
  is a default setup on many (most? all?) distributions. Change with
  --bindir= to configure
- The desktop file  and icons are installed under ~/.local/share. This is
  according to opendesktop specs, and most tools will find them there. Not all,
  though. Change with --datadir= to ./configure.
- Manpage goes also to ~/.local/share/man/man1. Your MANPATH will probably need
  an update to include  $HOME/.local/share/man. Change dir with --mandir=
  to ./configure. Manpage isn't that useful anyway.
- If you want to tweak the paths using e. g. --bindir= or --datadir= you must
  enter these options *after* the --user option.
